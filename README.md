## Introduction

This repository contains resources and examples on Unsupervised Learning Methods. It aims to introduce and apply unsupervised learning techniques to Earth observation data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of unsupervised learning methods.
- Learn to apply K-means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models to classify Earth observation data.
- Classify the echoes in leads and sea ice and produce an average echo shape as well as standard deviation for these two classes.

## Key Concepts

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques used when training data is not labeled.
- **K-means Clustering**: A method to partition data into K distinct clusters.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: A probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population.
- **Plotting pictures**: Using code to add legends and titles etc, change colors, specify the line displayed.

## Preperation
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Required Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)**

## Sections
- **Unsupervised Learning**: An introductory section that outlines the basics of unsupervised learning, including its significance and applications.

- **K-means Clustering**: Discusses the K-means algorithm, its key components, and the iterative process. Highlights the advantages and provides a basic code implementation for understanding and application.

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Introduces GMM, detailing why it's used for clustering, its key components, and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
Explains the advantages of GMM and includes basic code implementation.

- **Application to Image and Altimetry Classification**: Demonstrates the application of K-means and GMM in image classification and altimetry data classification, including necessary code and functions.
