## Introduction

This repository contains resources and examples on Unsupervised Learning Methods. It aims to introduce and apply unsupervised learning techniques to Earth observation data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of unsupervised learning methods.
- Learn to apply K-means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models to classify Earth observation data.
- Classify the echoes in leads and sea ice and produce an average echo shape as well as standard deviation for these two classes.

## Key Concepts

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques used when training data is not labeled.
- **K-means Clustering**: A method to partition data into K distinct clusters.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: A probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population.
- **Plotting pictures**: Using code to add legends and titles etc, change colors, specify the line displayed.

## How to Use

This section guides users through setting up their environment, downloading datasets, and running example scripts.
